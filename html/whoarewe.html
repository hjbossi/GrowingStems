      <p> Hannah Bossi is a PhD student at Yale University and an NSF GRFP Fellow. She studies nuclear physics working on the ALICE experiment which is a detector at the world's largest machine; the Large Hadron Collider. There, she studies the results of extremely hot and dense heavy-ion collisions which are designed to recreate the conditions of the early universe. Outside of physics, Hannah is a fan of almost anything outside. Whether it's running, hiking, yoga, rock climbing, or skiing - she is always up for some time outside with friends! </p>
